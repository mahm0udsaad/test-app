Welcome to the Test App repository! This project demonstrates a simple yet comprehensive full-stack web application that combines the power of modern frontend technologies and backend frameworks. The app is built using React, Framer Motion, and Tailwind CSS on the frontend, while the backend is developed using Express.js and leverages the MongoDB database for data storage.
## Overview
The Test App serves as a foundation for learning and exploring the integration of various technologies to create a functional and interactive web application. It showcases key concepts in frontend and backend development, such as responsive design, user interface animations, server-side scripting, and database interactions.

## Features
- **Frontend Magic with React and Framer Motion:** The frontend of the app is designed using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Framer Motion, a feature-rich animation library, enhances user experience by bringing visual elements to life with smooth animations.

- **Responsive Styling with Tailwind CSS:** Tailwind CSS simplifies styling with utility classes, allowing for efficient and responsive design without sacrificing customization. The app showcases the power of Tailwind CSS in creating visually appealing user interfaces.

- **Express.js Backend and MongoDB Integration:** The backend of the app is powered by Express.js, a flexible Node.js framework for building web applications and APIs. It integrates seamlessly with MongoDB, a NoSQL database, to provide data storage and retrieval capabilities.
